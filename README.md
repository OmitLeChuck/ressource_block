# dwarfmaster - ressource_block / ore orb

A block that can be made by the player and provides just about all the resources you need.
However, these resources can only be mined with the axes provided for this purpose.

With all other tools you can destroy the block, but not harvest anything.

When the block is dismantled, you get it back and have to reposition it to harvest. This is so that you can't harvest endlessly with one mouse button held down.

The speed of the axes is increased and XP is greatly reduced.

## Installation

copy the folder in to your Mods-folder (local or serverside) - restart - ready

## Modders

Of course, you can still change some of the mod, such as adding more resources and even more axes.
